The Text Editor Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a versatile tool accessible directly within the browser, designed for creating and managing code snippets or notes. It offers a seamless experience across various devices and platforms, adapting to different screen sizes and supporting features like offline access. Leveraging modern web technologies such as [IndexedDB](https://web.dev/articles/indexeddb) for data persistence, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling JavaScript files, and [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) for offline functionality, the application ensures efficient performance and reliability.
